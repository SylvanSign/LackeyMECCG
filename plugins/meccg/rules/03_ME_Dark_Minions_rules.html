			<font size="+1"><A NAME="MinionCards"></A>Minion Cards (Clarification)</FONT>

			<P>MEDM includes minion cards-a new type of card with a new type of template-the
			background is iron with a &quot;rusted&quot; purple tint. In MEDM, minions
			are used as hazards called agents. An agent is a hazard that represents
			an individual that has been sent on a covert mission by the Dark-lord or
			one of his Dark Lieutenants. However, not all agents are minions. The two
			agents on the normal hazard template are &quot;non-Minion agents:&quot;
			My Precious and Lobelia Sackville Baggins. </P>

			<P>The concept of minions used in a non-agent fashion will be introduced
			in Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye (a stand-alone expansion due out in the
			Spring of 1997). In The Lidless Eye, minions will be used like characters,
			but each minion will be under the influence of one of Sauron's Dark Lieutenants.
			</P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="PEvents"></A>Permanent-events (Clarification)</FONT>

			<P>If one of your companies splits into two or more companies, you may place
			any resource permanent-events that were on the original company (as a whole)
			with any of the resulting companies. Some events of this type must be discarded
			(as specified) when a company splits (e.g., Fellowship).</P>

			<P>You may not make an influence attempt on an item with a permanent event
			on it.</P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Placement"></A>Placement of cards &quot;off to the side&quot;
			(Clarification)</FONT>

			<P>Certain cards and effects require other cards be placed &quot;off to
			the side&quot; (for example, Sacrifice of Form from Middle-earth: The Wizards).
			Cards placed off to the side are placed on the playing surface off to the
			side of the normal area of play. Such cards are kept with their host permanent-event
			that caused this effect. Any card placed off to the side absolutely cannot
			be targeted or otherwise affected by the game except by cards that specifically
			affect cards placed &quot;off to the side.&quot; </P>

			<P>Cards placed off to the side are in play for the purposes of uniqueness.
			Unless stated otherwise, when a host permanent-event is removed from the
			playing surface, any cards placed off to the side under it are discarded.</P>

			<P>Usually the host card will state some mechanic that affects the cards
			placed off to the side with it. Unless stated otherwise on its host card,
			a card placed off to the side will give its marshalling points to its owner.
			However, the cards typical with Middle-earth: Dark Minions are &quot;taking
			prisoners&quot; cards, and characters taken prisoner yield negative marshalling
			points.</P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="UnderDeeps"></A>THE UNDER-DEEPS</FONT>

			<P><I>Note: Created by streams of molten rock and expanded by geothermal
			eruptions of super-hot gas, the Under-deeps are a result of a combination
			of natural and supernatural forces. The hand of Morgoth joined what was
			once a collection of countless, sundered cavern complexes. His greater servants
			used this maze of tunnels and chambers to travel surreptitiously throughout
			Endor. </I></P>

			<P>Although Endor changed during the Elder Days, the core of the Under-deeps
			survive. Though travel between the underground sites is now difficult, if
			not impossible, for all but the greatest (and luckiest) explorers. Blocked
			or twisting away from their original course, the Under-deeps seem broken.
			Junctions and strongholds seem lost. Many appear as simple caves or side
			passages, no longer resembling their past grandeur. Others lie hidden behind
			veils of rock. Nearly all are still there, though, awaiting discovery-as
			is their creator.</P>

			<P>An Under-deeps site card has &quot;Under-deeps&quot; in the section that
			normally gives a site's region, and its name contains &quot;-deeps&quot;
			or &quot;Under-&quot; An Under-deeps site is just like any other site with
			the following exceptions: </P>

			<UL>
				<LI>Unlike other sites, each Under-deeps site is not considered to be in
				a region-instead it is located below another site, called the Under-deeps
				site's surface site. </LI>
				<LI>Instead of a nearest Haven, each Under-deeps site lists all of its
				&quot;Adjacent Sites.&quot; Each Under-deeps site is adjacent to its one
				surface site and a number of other Under-deeps sites. The first adjacent
				site listed is always the Under-deeps site's surface site. </LI>
				<LI>Eagle-mounts and Gwaihir cannot be used to move to or from an Under-deeps
				site.</LI>
				<LI>A company moving to and/or from an Under-deeps site has no site path.
				So, hazards may only be played keyed to the company's new site. </LI>
				<LI>An environment card that changes site type (e.g., Choking Shadows,
				Quiet Lands, etc.) cannot be used to change the site type of an Under-deeps
				site.</LI>
				<LI>Normally, when you successfully play an item, faction, ally, or information
				at a site, the site card is tapped and one additional character may tap
				to play a minor item. At an Under-deeps site, you can play any item playable
				at the site instead of this minor item.</LI>
				<LI>You may not consider marshalling points associated with a company at
				an Under-deeps site for the purposes of calling the Free Council.</LI>
			</UL>

			<P><HR></P>

			<P><B>Example:</B><BR>
			Legolas taps and plays Glamdring (a major item) at The Under-grottos and
			the site taps. At this point, Gimili could only tap to play a minor item
			at a non-Under-deeps site. But The Under-grottos is an Under-deeps site,
			so Gimili can tap to play anything playable at The Under-grottos: a minor
			item, a major item, or a gold ring. He taps and plays a Precious Gold-ring.</P>

			<P><HR></P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="SiteMovement"></A>Under-deep Site Movement</FONT>

			<P>One of your companies that begins its turn at the surface site of an
			Under-deeps site can move normally or it can move to its adjacent Under-deeps
			site (i.e., the company moves to an Under-deeps site from its surface site).
			One of your companies that begins its turn at an Under-deeps site may only
			move to one of the adjacent sites listed on the Under-deeps site card.</P>

			<P>Each adjacent site is followed by a number in parentheses-this number
			indicates how difficult it is to move from the Under-deeps site to the adjacent
			site. When an adjacent site is revealed by one of your companies whose site
			of origin is an Under-deeps site, you must make a roll (2D6). If the result
			is greater than or equal to the number in parentheses following the adjacent
			site as listed on its site of origin, the movement/hazard phase proceeds
			normally. Otherwise, the company returns to its site of origin and the movement/hazard
			phase proceeds as if the company had not moved. </P>

			<P><I>Note: A company moving from a surface site to its Under-deeps site
			does not need to make a roll.</I></P>

			<P><HR></P>

			<P><B>Example: </B><BR>
			A company that starts at Carn D&ucirc;m can move normally or it can move
			to The Iron-deeps-The Iron-deeps lists Carn D&ucirc;m as an adjacent site.
			Similarly, a company that starts at The Iron-deeps may attempt to move to
			any adjacent site listed: Carn D&ucirc;m (0), The Under-leas (6), or The
			Under-vaults (7). However, after committing to movement, the moving player
			must roll a 6 or better to successfully move to The Under-leas or a 7 or
			better to successfully move to The Under-vaults.</P>

			<P><HR></P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Manifestations"></A>MANIFESTATIONS</FONT>

			<P>Certain entities (e.g., the Balrog, Gollum, Lobelia, etc.) have several
			different manifestations, each represented by a different MECCG card. </P>

			<UL>
				<LI>If one manifestation of such an entity is already in play, you may
				not play another manifestation of the same entity.</LI>
				<LI>If an attack from a manifestation is defeated, the manifestation is
				removed from play and you may not play any further manifestations of the
				same entity.</LI>
			</UL>

			<P><B>Exception</B>: Different manifestations of the same unique Dragon
			may be in play at the same time. </P>

			<P><I>Note: If one card says that it is the manifestation of another card,
			these restrictions apply to both cards.</I></P>

			<P><HR></P>

			<P><B>Example</B>: <BR>
			Gollum (the ally manifestation of Gollum) is in play with one of your characters.
			So, neither you nor your opponent can play My Precious (the agent manifestation
			of Gollum) until Gollum is discarded. If your Gollum is eliminated, My Precious
			and your opponent's Gollum (if any) may never be played.</P>

			<P><HR></P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Prisoners"></A>TAKING PRISONERS</FONT>

			<P>Certain hazard permanent-events cause a character to be taken prisoner-these
			are called hazard hosts. A character taken prisoner immediately leaves his
			original company and is placed under its hazard host &quot;off to the side.&quot;
			Additionally, the player playing the hazard host must take a site card from
			his location deck and place it with the hazard host-this is called the rescue
			site. Playing a rescue site is governed by the following rules. </P>

			<OL>
				<LI>Any restrictions listed on the hazard host must be observed (e.g.,
				it must be a Ruins &amp; Lairs, must have an Orc automatic-attack, etc.).</LI>
				<LI>If the hazard host is played on a character moving with region movement,
				the rescue site must be a site located in a region in which the character
				was moving or in a region adjacent to a region in which the character was
				moving.</LI>
				<LI>If the hazard host is played on a character moving with starter movement,
				the rescue site must be located in the region containing the site of origin
				or the new site.</LI>
				<LI>If the hazard host is played on a character not moving, the rescue
				site must be located in the same region as the character's site.</LI>
				<LI>If the hazard host is played on a character moving to a new site that
				is an adjacent site of an Under-deeps site, the rescue site can be that
				Under-deeps site.</LI>
				<LI>If a rescue site is not available within these rules, the hazard host
				cannot be played! </LI>
				<LI>When removed from the play surface, rescue sites always return to the
				location deck.</LI>
			</OL>

			<P>When taken prisoner, a character cannot take any actions (including healing
			or untapping) and cannot be affected by any cards except for those that
			specifically affect characters taken prisoner. A character taken prisoner
			is not controlled (i.e., does not use any influence), and all of his followers
			revert to general influence (which must be legally reconciled during his
			player's next organization phase). Any items, allies, or events controlled
			by a character are discarded when the character is taken prisoner unless
			the hazard host states otherwise. As an exception, a ring born by an imprisoned
			character stays with the character.</P>

			<P>While a prisoner, a character yields negative character marshalling points
			equal to the marshalling points he normally would give. If eliminated while
			imprisoned, the character yields these negative character marshalling points
			permanently (place the character's card in your marshalling point pile).
			</P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Rescue"></A>Rescue and the Rescue-attack</FONT>

			<P>Hazard hosts that cause a character to be taken prisoner require a company
			controlled by the player of the imprisoned character to rescue the character
			in order to return him to a normal status of play. Alternatively, if the
			hazard host is discarded by a non-rescue mechanism (e.g., by Marvels Told),
			the character forms his own company at the rescue site. At any point outside
			of the initial attack or conditions by which a hazard host is played, the
			hazard host is discarded if there are no imprisoned characters are under
			it. Whenever, the hazard host is discarded, the rescue site always returns
			to the location deck.</P>

			<P>To rescue a character, the company must be at the rescue site during
			the site phase and must face any automatic-attacks at the site as normal.
			The site can be tapped or untapped. The company must next face any rescue-attacks
			at the site. Rescue-attacks are not considered automatic-attacks. Following
			the rescue-attack, an untapped character in the rescuing company can tap,
			and all characters taken prisoner under the hazard host immediately join
			the company under general influence (which must be legally reconciled during
			the player's next organization phase)-the rescue attempt is successful.
			The company's site then taps (if untapped), and one minor item may be played
			with an untapped member of the rescuing company. </P>

			<P><I>Note: If he has one available, a player must use a site from his own
			location deck to rescue imprisoned characters. If he does not have the site
			or if the site is in his discard pile, the copy with the hazard host can
			be used to show the rescuing company's movement (if the rescue attempt is
			successful, the site would remain in play until the company leaves the site).
			In this case the site is not available for the rescuing player to use for
			any purpose (other than to rescue prisoners and play one minor item) until
			the company leaves the site and his play deck is exhausted.</I></P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Agents"></A>AGENTS</FONT>

			<P>An agent has the same attributes as a character: race, skills, direct
			influence, prowess, body, mind, marshalling points, and special abilities.
			During play, each agent must be in one of the following states: face-down
			and untapped, face-down and tapped, face-up and untapped, face-up and tapped,
			or face-up and wounded.</P>

			<P>An agent can be thought of as a hazard that acts as a creature with the
			following special effects:</P>

			<UL>
				<LI>It normally remains in play until it is eliminated.</LI>
				<LI>If using the minimum number of creatures requirement (i.e., in the
				Council of L&oacute;rien tournament rules) for a starting play deck, each
				agent only counts as half a creature.</LI>
				<LI>The total of the mind attributes of all of your agents in your play
				deck and sideboard may not exceed 36. </LI>
			</UL>

			<P>An agent is always located at a site. Once an agent has been revealed
			or has moved to a site that is not one of its home sites, one of your site
			cards must be used for this purpose. A face-up agent's site card must always
			be face-up. Agents move and operate alone (i.e., they do not move and operate
			in &quot;companies&quot;). </P>

			<P>Each agent is unique-all normal rules apply. If a specific agent is in
			play face-up and a second, identical agent is turned face-up (i.e., it is
			revealed), the second agent is immediately discarded.</P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Untapping"></A>Untapping an Agent</FONT>

			<P>Each of your agents untaps during your untap phase.</P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Playing"></A>Playing an Agent</FONT>

			<P>To play an agent, place it face-down (and untapped). The agent is assumed
			to be at any one of its home sites (no site card is required). </P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Actions"></A>Agent Actions</FONT>

			<P>Each of your agents who was already in play at the beginning of your
			opponent's turn may take one and only one of the following actions each
			turn. </P>

			<UL>
				<LI>A tapped or untapped agent may move to a non-Haven, non-Under-deeps
				site in the same region or in an adjacent region (see below). The agent
				taps if not already tapped.</LI>
				<LI>An agent may return to its home site (i.e., remove all of the site
				cards on the agent). </LI>
				<LI>An agent may tap to make certain creatures playable at its current
				site (see below).</LI>
				<LI>A wounded agent may heal (i.e., move from wounded status to tapped
				status).</LI>
				<LI>A tapped agent may untap (i.e., move from tapped status to utapped
				status). [NOTE: This rule does not appear in the rules insert with the
				booster packs. This rule is correct and should be considered as though
				it were printed in the rules insert.]</LI>
				<LI>An untapped, face-up agent may be turned face-down along with its site
				card.</LI>
			</UL>

			<P>Performing any one of these actions with an agent counts as one against
			the hazard limit. These actions may only be taken during your opponent's
			movement/hazard phase.</P>

			<P><I>Note: Certain cards allow an agent to take more than one action during
			a given turn.</I></P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Moving"></A>Moving an Agent (Agent Action)</FONT>

			<P>When one of your agents moves, tap it and place its new site card on
			top of the agent and any other site cards already on the agent (face-up
			if the agent is face-up, face-down if the agent is face-down). If the agent
			is face-up, return to your location deck all site cards other than the new
			site card. Thus, the top site card on an agent indicates its current site.
			</P>

			<P>Alternatively, you may remove the top site card on a face-down agent
			(i.e., it moves back to its previous site).</P>

			<P><I>Note: If Starter Rules are being used and/or you are not using region
			movement, agents may not move. </I></P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Revealing"></A>Revealing an Agent</FONT>

			<P>You may turn any of your face-down agents face-up (i.e., reveal them)
			at any time during your opponent's movement/hazard phase. This doesn't count
			as an agent action as outlined above and it doesn't count against the hazard
			limit. Alternatively, you must reveal an agent when it attacks, when it
			makes an influence attempt, or when certain cards are played.</P>

			<P><I>Note: Certain hazard cards specify that an agent must tap for the
			card to take effect. A face-down agent that taps in this fashion must be
			revealed (i.e., turned face-up).</I></P>

			<P>If one of your agents is revealed before it has moved, you must immediately
			choose which home site it is at-place the appropriate site card with the
			agent. If you do not have such a site card in your location deck, discard
			the agent at the end of the current turn.</P>

			<P>If one of your agents is revealed after it has moved, the first site
			card that was played must be one of its home sites or it must be in the
			same region as one of the agent's home sites or it must be in a region adjacent
			to a region that contains one of the agent's home sites. Any site card other
			than the first site card must be in the same region as the previous site
			placed on the agent or it must be in a region adjacent to the region that
			contains the previous site placed on the agent. </P>

			<P>If one of your agent's series of sites indicating its travel is illegal,
			the agent has no effect. In addition, it is immediately discarded and any
			site cards associated with the agent are returned to your location deck.</P>

			<P>When one of your agents and its site cards are revealed, all site cards
			other than the agent's current site card are returned to your location deck
			(after verifying that the path of movement was legal).</P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="PlayingCreatures"></A>Playing Creatures at an Agent's Site
			(Agent Action)</FONT>

			<P>If one of your agents and one of your opponent's companies are both at
			the same Ruins &amp; Lairs, Shadow-hold, or Dark-hold, you may tap the agent
			and then attack that company with any non-unique hazard creatures (regardless
			of what they are keyed to) of the same creature type as the site's automatic-attack.
			</P>

			<P>If one of your agents and one of your opponent's companies are both at
			the agent's home site, you may tap the agent and then attack that company
			with certain hazard creatures (regardless of what they are keyed to) based
			upon the site type:</P>

			<UL>
				<LI>You may play Men, Dwarves, Elves, D&uacute;nedain, and Hobbits at Free-Holds.</LI>
				<LI>You may play Orcs, Nazg&ucirc;l, Men, Dwarves, Elves, D&uacute;nedain,
				and Hobbits at Border-Holds.</LI>
				<LI>You may play Orcs, Nazg&ucirc;l, and Trolls at Ruins &amp; Lairs.</LI>
				<LI>You may play Orcs, Nazg&ucirc;l, Undead, and Trolls at Shadow-Holds.</LI>
				<LI>You may play Orcs, Nazg&ucirc;l, and Trolls at Dark-Holds.</LI>
			</UL>

			<P>In either case, if a creature is played in this manner, the agent is
			revealed (if it was not already revealed).</P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Attacking"></A>Attacking With an Agent</FONT>

			<P>During your opponent's site phase, each of your agents may attack a company
			if the following conditions are met:</P>

			<UL>
				<LI>The agent is at the same site as the company. </LI>
				<LI>The company decides to enter the site.</LI>
			</UL>

			<P>This attack is declared and enacted at the start of the site phase immediately
			following any automatic-attack. If face-down, turn the agent face-up.</P>

			<P><I>Note: Certain cards (e.g., Cunning Foes, To Get You Away, etc.) allow
			an agent at a company's new site to attack a company during the movement/hazard
			phase.</I></P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Resolving"></A>Resolving Combat With an Agent</FONT>

			<P>When one of your agents attacks it is considered to be the attacker and
			it has one strike unless modified. Combat with an agent is handled like
			any other combat with the following exceptions:</P>

			<UL>
				<LI>The prowess for each of the agent's strikes is modified by a roll (2D6)-a
				separate roll is made for each strike.</LI>
				<LI>A wounded agent's prowess is modified by -2.</LI>
				<LI>If the agent is face-down when the attack is declared, one of the following
				applies: 
				<UL>
					<LI>If at his home site, his prowess is modified by +5 for that attack
					and his body is modified by +1 and the attacker chooses defending characters.
					</LI>
					<LI>If not at his home site, his prowess is modified by +2 for that attack.
					</LI>
				</UL>
			</LI>
				<LI>If a face-down agent attacks as the result of the play of a card, the
				agent is considered to be face-down when the attack is declared. </LI>
				<LI>If the agent is face-up at his home site when the attack is declared,
				his prowess is modified by +2 for that attack and his body is modified
				by +1.</LI>
				<LI>After the combat, the agent remains in play and it must be face-up
				and tapped or face-up and wounded.</LI>
			</UL>

			<P><I>Note: Agents are not characters-you may not play resource cards to
			modify an agent's prowess (e.g., a Risky Blow will not affect an agent's
			prowess). Hazard cards affect an agent attack normally.</I></P>

			<P><HR></P>

			<P><B>Example:</B><BR>
			During your opponent's movement/hazard phase (MH-phase), you play Gisulf,
			counting as one against your hazard limit. He is placed face-down and is
			considered to start at any of his home sites: Woodmen-town, Lake-town, or
			Dale (your choice whenever he is initially revealed). Gisulf may not take
			an action this turn-he was just played. However, if one of your opponent's
			companies were to move to one of Gisulf's home sites this turn, Gisulf could
			attack it during its site phase.</P>

			<P><HR></P>

			<P>During your opponent's next MH-phase, his main company moves to L&oacute;rien.
			You decide to move Gisulf to a site in the Anduin Vales so that he is closer
			to more sites reachable from L&oacute;rien. He can do this because Woodmen-town
			is in Western Mirkwood, which is adjacent to Anduin Vales. One of your own
			company's is at Eagle's Eyrie and Framsburg is in your discard pile, so
			those cards are not available for Gisulf to use. Thus, Gisulf can only move
			to Gladden Fields or Beorn's House. You move him to Gladden Fields (counts
			one against the hazard limit), tapping him and placing that site card (his
			current site) face-down on top of Gisulf. Maybe your opponent will try to
			get a ring next turn. </P>

			<P>Gisulf untaps during your untap phase. During your opponent's next MH-phase,
			his main company reveals that it is moving to Goblin-gate. Since Goblin-gate
			is in High Pass and High Pass is adjacent to Anduin Vales, you move Gisulf
			to Goblin-gate-tapping him and placing your Goblin-gate site card (his current
			site) face-down on top of him.</P>

			<P>At this point Gisulf is at the company's new site and you could play
			certain hazard cards: e.g., Seek Without Success (returns the company to
			its site of origin). Unfortunately, you don't have any of these cards in
			your hand.</P>

			<P>During the site phase, the company enters Goblin-gate and faces the automatic-attack.
			Then, you decide to attack them with Gisulf. He is turned face-up and the
			site cards on Gisulf are revealed and checked. He traveled from Woodmen-town
			(his chosen starting home site) in Western Mirkwood to Gladden Fields in
			Anduin Vales to Goblin-gate in High Pass. Each of these regions is adjacent
			to the previous one played, so Gisulf moved legally. The Gladden Fields
			site card is returned to your location deck and Goblin-gate is left face-up
			with Gisulf.</P>

			<P>Gisulf's prowess for this attack is 7 (5 normal, +2 because he was face-down
			when the attack was declared). Elladan is untapped and is in the target
			company, so your opponent chooses him to take the attack. Elladan's prowess
			is 5 (his normal prowess of 5 because he decides to tap). You (Gisulf) roll
			an eight for a total of 15, while your opponent rolls a six for a total

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Marshalling"></A>Marshalling Points from Agents</FONT>

			<P>Only your opponent can receive marshalling points by defeating an agent
			that you played. If you defeat an agent that you played, it is removed from
			the game and no one receives its marshalling points.</P>

			<P>Marshalling points from defeating an agent count as kill points not as
			character points.</P>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Influencing"></A>Influencing With an Agent </FONT>

			<P>During your opponent's movement/hazard phase, certain cards and special
			abilities allow your agents to attempt to influence allies, factions, followers,
			and characters. After an influence attempt, the agent remains face-up and
			in play. </P>

			<P>To influence an ally, follower, or character, the agent must be at the
			new site for the target or at the target's current site if the company did
			not move. To influence a faction, the agent must be at the site at which
			the faction is playable. </P>

			<P>To attempt to influence in this manner, your agent must make an influence
			check as outlined in section 9 of the Standard Rules. However, the following
			exceptions apply:</P>

			<UL>
				<LI>Your agent's unused direct influence and any other modifications are
				used (i.e., the agent is doing the influencing, not a character).</LI>
				<LI>If your agent is at his home site his direct influence is modified
				by +2.</LI>
				<LI>You can't use resources cards to help the attempt (e.g., you may not
				reveal an identical resource card, you may not use a Muster, etc.).</LI>
				<LI>If the target character (or follower) has the same home site as the
				agent, treat the character's (or follower's) mind attribute as zero and
				your agent's roll is modified by +2.</LI>
				<LI>If the target ally is playable at the agent's home site, treat the
				ally's mind attribute as zero and your agent's roll is modified by +2.</LI>
				<LI>If the target faction is playable at the agent's home site, treat the
				number required to bring the faction into play as zero and your agent's
				roll is modified by +2.</LI>
			</UL>

			<font size="+1"><A NAME="Automatic"></A>Creatures As Automatic-Attacks</FONT>

			<P>Any hazard creature you play as an automatic-attack is discarded if defeated-it
			is not placed in your opponent's marshalling point pile. <BR>
