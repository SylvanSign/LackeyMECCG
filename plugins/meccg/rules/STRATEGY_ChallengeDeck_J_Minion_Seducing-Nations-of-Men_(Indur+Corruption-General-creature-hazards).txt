Resource Play 
Your goal should be to play 5 of the 6 man factions at the 3 Border-holds surrounding Mordor. Essential to playing two at one site is the minor item, Secret Book. It may become a chore moving a character to a Border-holdjust to untap it with this item, but it is often necessary. 
High Helm can help The Mouth or Horseman in the night with their influence attempts. Pay close attention to the Standard Modifications factions in play give. You may receive more bonusses here than anticipated. 
Hador plays a very important part in the succes of this deck. He casts a powerful attack avoidance sorcery, Tormented Earth. When not needed otherwise, tap another character to hlep Hador with the corruption check from this spell. Note that Hador can play Tormented Earth even if tapped or wounded. Slayers are a real threat, so save Ready to His Will to make this creature an ally and stop its attacks.
One or more companies of Orcs should form at Dol Guldur. These are responsible for playing most of the non-faction resources. Never hesitate to sacrifice an Orc to a large attack for the greater good of Sauron. 

Indur 
Indur does not move. He uses his special ability to bring discarded Tormented Earths back to your hand. If enough attack avoidance is otherwise in hand, Indur can tap during his organization phase to bring a resource to the play deck. Poisonous Despair works best if taken to the discard pile first. Indur can bring this to your hand if your opponent becomes a threat to influence your marshalling points away.

Hazard Play 
The hazards have a high frequency of play so that the Secret Books cycle into your hand quickly. The creatures will not consistently threaten your opponent, but your corruption should have a profound effect. A prudent opponent will slow down his movement to take time removing the corruption cards; a careless opponent will take costy losses from failed corruption checks. 

Sideboard 
The sideboard contains an additional 8 marshalling points of resources. They work well coming into the deck for the second deck cycle. If your companies are in good shape tactically, tap Indur to bring some of them in sooner.
