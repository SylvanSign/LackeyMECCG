Resource Play 
Untapped scouts can play a crucial part in the success of Gandalf's deck. They provide your main means of attack avoidance by using Concealments and Stealths. There are enough weapons in your deck to make Aragorn and a couple other warriors from the play deck into formidable fighters, so expect to receive a few marshaling points from creature kills. 
Ultimately, you want to give Arwen a Lesser Ring. This provides her with enough direct influence to control Aragorn. These two form a powerful 2-character company who require only 3 general influence. With Return of the King on Aragorn, he can recruit any faction in the deck virtually automatically. If you play Tower Guard of Minas Tirith before Return of the King, be sure to leave a character at Minas Tirith so that the site is still available to play Return of the King. Return of the King does not require the site to tap, nor is its play limited to the site phase. 

Gandalf 
One of Gandalf's primary tasks is testing the 3 Beautiful Gold Rings with his special ability. This means Gandalf must be untapped and must have joined the company bearing the ring. It should not strain your hand too much to hold the Magic Ring of Stealth and Lesser Rings waiting for the gold rings and Gandalf's test. Otherwise, in a company with other characters, Gandalf should feel free to move around gathering resources. 

Hazard Play 
The hazards offer a wide variety of creatures with good attacks in acomplete range ofregions and sites. Except for Searching Eye, each hazard is playable on its own, without directly benefiting from another. This means the hazards do not require you to hold cards in hand waiting for an optimal complementary hazard before playing them. If you must discard and have a creature in hand you are not certain you can play soon, discard it and do not look back. The resource strategy needs all the tactical supporting cards it can get, so freely sacrifice hazards to make room. 

Sideboard 
Tap Gandalf to bring in the 2 factions after playing Return of the King. Otherwise the resources in the sideboard offer general options to defendagainst specific opponents. This quality of generality holds even more for with the sideboard hazards.
