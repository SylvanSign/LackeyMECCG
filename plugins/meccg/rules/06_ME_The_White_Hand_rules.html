		<P>
		During the Third Age, the Valar sent five Maiar to Middle-earth to help the Free Peoples resist Sauron. However they were forbidden to dominate the peoples of Middle-earth or to match the power of Sauron with power. They were known as the five "Wizards": Alatar, Gandalf, Pallando, Radagast, and Saruman.
		<P>
		In the <I>Lord of the Rings</I>, Gandalf was the only Wizard to remain true to his mission. Saruman was corrupted by power, Radagast "went native" and Alatar and Pallando disappeared into the East to pursue their own goals.
		<P>
		<I>Middle-earth: The White Hand</I> allows you to play one of these
		"Fallen-wizards.: As a Fallen-wizard, you can pick and choose the good and evil resources you will try to utilize - you will use any means to achieve your ends. However, you can only exert your influence and control over the weaker heroes and minions - the more powerful characters can sense your greed and weakness.
		<P>
		Each Fallen-wizard is driven by a different obsession reflected in his abilities
		and goals:
		<P>
		The fallen <B>Pallando</B> (Master of Doom) is the master of peoples
		and fate. He rules and dominates peoples. He is obsessed with building his own empire and defeating Sauron by force of arms.
		<P>
		The fallen <B>Alatar</B> (Lord of the Hunt) is the master of animate
		nature - he is a hunter. He likes to do things personally. He is more likely to dominate individuals rather than peoples. He is obsessed with defeating Sauron by turning Middle-earth into a well-ordered game-preserve.
		<P>
		The fallen <B>Gandalf</B> (the Careworn) is the friend of peoples, fate, and Middle-earth. He manipulates peoples and their rulers rather than dominate them - he is not an empire builder. He has lost hope of defeating Sauron. He just wants to delay the Dark Lord's final victory as long as possible, and to save as many of the Free Peoples as possible.
		<P>
		The fallen <B>Radagast</B> (of the Greenwood) is the friend of animate nature. He looks at Middle-earth as a big garden with people as the gardners. He persuades but doesn't dominate. He plans to help nature protect itself from the Dark Lord.
		<P>
		The fallen <B>Saruman </B>(of Many Colors) is the master of inanimate nature. He gather knowledge and makes inanimate objects. He is obsessed with using his own personal power, items, and abilities to contest Sauron.
		<P>
		<I>Note: In the terms of Middle-earth: The Wizards, a Wizard that has failed a corruption check by 1 or 2 has become a <B>Fallen-wizard</B> (the Wizards in ME:WH are all Fallen-wizards).</I>
		<P>
		<font size="+1"><B><A NAME="USING">USING				    ME:WH</A></B></FONT>
		<P>
		When you play a Fallen-wizard, assume that your Fallen-wizard is a METW "Wizard".
		<B>All of the normal METW rules apply except for the specific exceptions outlined in these rules</B>. The ME:LE rules that concern Wizards also apply to Fallen-wizards.
		<P>
		You should read the following section to get a general idea of how to play a Fallen-wizard. Then read the rest of the rules for specific details.
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="WIZARDS">WIZARDS</A> </B>- When the rules and cards refer to a Wizard, they apply to your Fallen-wizard.
		<P>
<B><A NAME="WIZARDHAVENS">WIZARDHAVENS</A></B> - When rules and non-site cards
refer to Havens and Darkhavens, they apply instead to your Wizardhavens. The
special effects of METW Havens (i.e healing, bringing characters into play,
etc.) now apply to your companies at your Wizardhavens. These same effects
do <B>not </B>apply to your companies at ME:LE Darkhavens and ME:TW Havens.
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="STAGE">STAGE POINTS</A></B> - Certain cards give your Fallen-wizard "stage points." Stage points reflect how far your Fallen-wizard has deviated from his original mission. You must keep track of your accumulated stage points. The number of stage points that a card gives is indicated by one of the following symbols:
		<P ALIGN=Center>
		<IMG SRC="spoints.gif" ALT="Stage Points [3kB]" WIDTH="283" HEIGHT="58">
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="RESOURCES">STAGE RESOURCES</A></B> - ME:WH introduces a new type of resource card called a <I>stage resource</I> card. Such a card is actually a "Fallen-wizard-only resource card" - only Fallen-wizard players  may include them in their decks. Stage resources have a green colored (i.e. tarnished copper) background. Most stage resource cards give stage points.
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="CHARACTERS">CHARACTERS</A> </B>- You may use both hero and minion characters. However, you may only use a character if his mind attribute is 5 or less. All of your non-Orc/Troll characters are considered to be hero characters. You may only use up to two of each non-unique character. <P>
		<B><A NAME="ORCS">ORCS &amp; TROLLS</A></B> - Because most Fallen-wizard characters will <I>not </I>be Orcs and Trolls, specific rules concerning <A HREF="#ORCTROLL">Orc and Troll characters</A> are collected in one section at the end of these rules.
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="HERO">HERO/MINION RESOURCES</A></B> - You may use both hero and minion resources. However, you may only include up to a total of two of each non-unique hero or minion resource in your play deck and sideboard.
		<P>
		<A NAME="SITES"><B>SITES</B></A> - There are four Fallen-wizard site cards: Isengard, The White Towers, Rhosgobel, and Deep Mines. These site cards have
		a light gray background. Unless stated otherwise on a card, a Fallen-wizard
		player may use these sites instead of the hero/minion versions. Most
		fallen-wizard companies use hero site cards when moving to non-Fallen-wizard
		sites (see <A HREF="#MOVEMENT">Movement section</A> for exceptions).
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="MARSHALLING">MARSHALLING POINTS</A></B> - Marshalling points
		for stage resource cards are handled normally (i.e. as printed on the card).
		However, all other marshalling point cards are only worth 1 marshalling point
		each to a Fallen-wizard (regardless of their printed value). These
		MPs can <B>not</B> be modified by a hero or minion resource event (e.g.
		<I>Rumor of the One, Tribute Garnered, Sentinels of N&uacute;menor</I>, etc.).
		However, Fallen-wizard abilities and stage resource cards <B>can</B>
		modify the number of marshalling points certain cards give.
		<P>
		<font size="+1"><B><A NAME="VICTORY">THE
		VICTORY CONDITIONS</A></B></FONT>
		<P>
		As a Fallen-wizard you may win in the same way a METW Wizard wins: your opponent
		is eliminated <B>or</B> you recover <I>The One Ring </I><B>or </B>you
		have the most marshalling points at the Free Council. The following exceptions
		apply:
		<UL>
			<LI>
	In order to win by recovering <I>The One Ring </I>at least <I>A
	New Ringlord</I> card must be played and the conditions outlined on
	that card must be met.
			<LI>
	The Free Council is handled normally, and victory is determined in the standard
	way by comparing marshalling points. However, to you (a Fallen-wizard) it
	is called your <B>Day of Reckoning</B> and your marshalling points reflect
	how far you have progressed towards completing your own personal goals.
			<LI>
	You do not receive marshalling points for cards stored at non-Wizardhaven
	sites.
		</UL>
		<P>
		<font size="+1"><B><A NAME="GETTING">GETTING
		READY TO PLAY</A></B></FONT>
		<P>
		A Fallen-wizard player prepares for play just as a Wizard does, with the
		following exceptions:
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="DECLARING">DECLARING THAT YOUR WIZARD IS FALLEN</A></B> - If
		you are playing a Fallen-wizard, you must tell your opponent which Fallen-wizard
		you are playing before choosing starting companies. If your opponent has
		normal hero Wizard character cards in his play deck and/or sideboard that
		correspond to the Fallen-wizard you have declared, he may replace those Wizard
		cards with an equal number of other Wizard character cards that he has available.
		Your opponent may also add 10 cards to his sideboard (these cards should
		be preselected for a Fallen-wizard opponent).
		<P>
		<I>Note: This rule means that when you declare that you are playing a specific
		Fallen-wizard, your opponent may not play the corresponding hero Wizard (i.e.
		that Wizard has already fallen). You and your opponent may still both declare
		and attempt to play the same Fallen-wizard, but the game will probably by
		won by the first player to get his Fallen-wizard into play.</I>
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="LOCATION">YOUR LOCATION DECK</A></B> - Your location deck may
		include multiple copies of the Fallen-wizard site cards: Isengard, The White
		Towers, Rhosgobel, and Deep Mines. However, your location deck may only include
		one of every hero and minion site.
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="PLAY">YOUR PLAY DECK</A></B> - The resource half of your play
		deck (and your sideboard) may include hero, minion and stage resources.
		But, you are limited to:
		<UL>
			<LI>
	One of each unique card (including cards with the same name)
			<LI>
	Three of each non-unique stage resource card
			<LI>
	Two of each non-unique character card
			<LI>
	Two of each non-unique hero resource card
			<LI>
	Two of each non-unique minion resource card
			<LI>
	You may not include stage resource cards that are "specific" to another
	Fallen-wizard (e.g. if you declare that you are Alatar, you may not include
	"Gandalf specific" cards).
			<LI>
	You may not include any of the following cards: The Balrog, Cracks of Doom,
	Favor of the Valar, Gollum's Fate, Hour of Need, Kill All But Not the Halflings,
	The Lidless Eye, The Sun Unveiled, Glamour of Surpassing Excellence, Messenger
	of Mordor, News Must Get Through, News of the Shire, Old Road, The Windlord
	Found Me, Wizard Uncloaked, Use Your Legs
		</UL>
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="STSTAGE">STARTING STAGE CARDS</A></B> - You must attempt to
		start with one, two, or three (your choice) stage
		resource permanent-event cards in play. these cards must have a combined
		total of three (3) stage points. At least one of these cards must be non-unique.
		You may not start such a card if the conditions required to play the card
		do not exist. These cards should be revealed as if they were starting characters
		with duplicate unique cards being discarded.
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="STCHAR">STARTING CHARACTERS</A></B> - Your starting characters
		(up to 5) may include hero characters and minion characters, but you
		may not start a character with a mind greater than 5. However, you may not
		start Orc and Troll characters unless you start with an appropriate stage
		resource card (e.g. Bad Company).
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="STSITE">STARTING SITE</A></B> - Your starting company may
		begin play at The White Towers or at any Ruins &amp; Lairs site in Rhudaur
		or Arthedain. If you start at a Ruins &amp; Lairs site, one of your
		starting stage resource cards may be a <I>Hidden Haven</I> played on
		your starting site.
		<P>
		<font size="+1"><B><A NAME="PLAYER">THE
		PLAYER TURN</A></B></FONT>
		<P>
		The player turn proceeds normally with the following exceptions:
		<UL>
			<LI>
	You may discard one of your stage resource cards already in play during your
	organization phase. You may <B>not</B> discard such a card if it would reduce
	your stage points below 3.
			<LI>
	You may only play stage resource permanent-events during your organization
	phase (unless a specific card states otherwise).
			<LI>
	Fallen-wizard companies may attack Ringwraith companies (see ME:LE rules,
	p. 80) and vice versa. However, non-overt Fallen-wizard companies and Wizard
	companies may not attack each other. (Over Fallen-wizard companies may attack
	any company controlled by another player, see the section on
	<A HREF="#ORCTROLL">Special Rules for Orcs and Trolls</A>).
		</UL>
		<P>
		<font size="+1"><B><A NAME="CANDC">CHARACTERS
		AND COMPANIES</A></B></FONT>
		<P>
		All of your non-Orc and non-Troll characters are considered to be hero
		characters. Thus, a company consisting of only such characters
		is treated as a hero company. Such a company is covert for the purposes of
		playing minion resources.
		<UL>
			<LI>
	Your Fallen-wizard may only start at his home site.
			<LI>
	You may not start or bring into play any character with a mind greater than
	5.
		</UL>
		<P>
		<I>Note: See the section on Orcs and Trolls for more details.</I>
		<P>
		<font size="+1"><B><A NAME="MOVEMENT">MOVEMENT</A></B></FONT>
		<P>
 Fallen-wizard companies <B>must</B>
		use region movement. When one of your Fallen-wizard companies moves to
		a site, you and your opponent draw cards based on the site being moved
		to. This applies even if moving to one of your Wizardhavens. The METW Havens
		(i.e. <I>Grey Havens, Rivendell, Lorien, Edhellond</I>) and ME:LE Darkhavens
		(i.e. <I>Minas Morgul, Dol Guldur, Carn D&ucirc;m and Geann a-Lisch</I>)
		are <B>not </B>considered to be havens for a Fallen-wizard player. The following
		exceptions for using sites can be modified by the play of certain hazards
		and stage resources.
		<UL>
			<LI>
	A fallen-wizard's non-overt companies must use hero sites for sites
	that are <I>not </I>Ruins &amp; Lairs.
			<LI>
	A Fallen-wizard's companies may freely use either minion or hero Ruins &amp;
	Lairs sites on a site per site basis (subject to the restriction below).
			<LI>
	If your hero (or minion) version of a site is in play or in your discard pile,
	you may not use you minion (or hero) version of the same site.
			<LI>
	The play of certain cards can change the type of sites that your companies
	mau use (e.g. <I>Plotting Ruin, Heart Grown Cold</I>, etc.). When this happens,
	immediately exchange any affected site cards already in play with the
	corresponding site cards of the proper type.
		</UL>
		<P>
		<font size="+1"><B><A NAME="CORRUPTION">CORRUPTION
		CHECKS</A></B></FONT>
		<P>
		Corruption checks are handled normally with these exceptions:
		<UL>
			<LI>
	Corruption checks for a Fallen-wizard are handled as if he were a minion
	character. That is, if the roll for a corruption check is equal to a
	Fallen-wizard's corruption point total or one less, he is tapped instead
	of being discarded. He is not considered to fail the corruption check in
	this case.
			<LI>
	Corruption checks for a Fallen-wizard's non-Orc and non-Troll character are
	handled as if the player were a Wizard.
			<LI>
	Corruption points given on all non-item stage resource cards apply to
	your Fallen-wizard.
		</UL>
		<P>
		<font size="+1"><A NAME="PLAYING"><B>PLAYING
		AND USING RESOURCES</B></A></FONT>
		<P>
		Playing resources is handled normally with these exceptions:
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="TESTING">TESTING GOLD RINGS</A></B> - Whenever a Fallen-wizard
		player tests a hero gold ring item, the roll is modified by -1.
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="TARGETING">TARGETING SITE AND RESOURCE CARDS </A></B>- A hero
		resource card may not target/affect a minion site card or a minion resource
		card. A minion resource card may not target/affect a hero site card or a
		hero resource card.
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="SITERESOURCE">PLAYING RESOURCES AT A SITE</A></B> - In order
		to play a non-Fallen-wizard resource that would normally tap a site, either
		the site and the resource to be played must both be hero cards or they must
		both be minion cards. For these purposes, a Fallen-wizard site card (or any
		Wizardhaven) is both a hero and minion site. This applies to all factions,
		allies, and items; as well as other cards played during the site phase that
		tap the site.
		<P>
		<I>Note: When the test of a gold ring indicates that a specific type
		of ring may be played, you may play either a hero or a minion ring of the
		appropriate type.</I>
		<P>
		<B><A NAME="ITEMS">USING ITEMS</A></B> - All non-Orc/Troll characters may
		freely use both hero and minion items.
		<P>
		<A NAME="LEAVE"><B>WHEN YOU FALLEN-WIZARD LEAVES PLAY</B></A> - If your
		Fallen-wizard leaves play, discard all of your stage resource permanent-events
		in play that are specific for your wizard (e.g. if you are Alatar and play
		<I>Sacrifice of Form</I>, you must discard all of your stage resource
		permanent-events that say "<I>Alatar specific</I>.") As is normally
		the case, all hazard permanent-events on such a wizard are discarded.
		<P>
		<A NAME="AGENTS"><B>USING SITES FOR AGENTS</B></A> - When moving an Agent
		hazard, a Fallen-wizard player must use hero site cards. If the minion version
		of a site card is in play or in your discard pile, your agents may not use
		or reveal the hero version of that site.
		<P>
		<font size="+1"><B><A NAME="ORCTROLL">SPECIAL
		ORC &amp; TROLL RULES</A></B></FONT>
		<P>
		A company with any Orc or Troll characters is an overt company. In addition,
		a company with any of the following allies is an overt company: Great
		Bats, Great Lord of Goblin-gate, Last Child of Ungoliant, Regiment of Black
		Crows, Two-headed Troll. Any other company is a hero company.
		<UL>
			<LI>
	Orcs that are "Half-orcs" are special - if a Half-orc is in a company with
	only Half-orcs and Men, the company is <B>not</B> overt (i.e. the Half-orcs
	appear to be ugly men to the casual observer). Half-orcs cannot take trophies.
	However, for all other purposes a Half-orc is considered an Orc.
			<LI>
	You may not play Orc and Troll characters until you have played the
	appropriate card (e.g. <I>Bad Company</I>).
			<LI>
	Unless at a Wizardhaven, and Orc or Troll cannot be in the same company as
	an Elf, Dwarf, D&uacute;nadan, or Hobbit.
			<LI>
	A Fallen-wizard overt company may attack any company controlled by another
	player and vise versa.
			<LI>
	A Fallen-wizard's overt companies must use hero sites for Shadow-holds, Dark-holds, and minion Darkhavens. They must use minion sites for Border-holds, Free-holds, and hero Havens.
			<LI>
	Overt companies are <B>not</B> minion companies for the purposes of the
	detainment attack guidelines in the ME:LE rules (p. 31). Overt companies
	are minion companies for hazards that can only attack/effect minion companies
	(i.e. <I>Sons of Kings</I>).
			<LI>
	Corruption checks for an Orc or Troll character are handled as if he were
	a minion character. That is, if the roll for a corruption check for
	an Orc or Troll character is equal to his corruption point total or one less,
	he is tapped instead of being discarded. He is not considered to fail the
	corruption check in this case.
			<LI>
	You may <B>not</B> play a hero resource permanent-event on a company
	with an Orc or Troll in it.
			<LI>
	A hero resource may not target an Orc or Troll character (e.g. Orc and
	Troll characters may not use <I>Block, Escape</I>, etc.).
			<LI>
	A hero resource that requires a character with a specific skill may
	not use an Orc or Troll character to fulfill that requirement (e.g.
	<I>Concealment, Many Turns and Doubling</I>s, etc.).
			<LI>
	An Orc or Troll character may not tap to initiate an effect from a hero resource
	(e.g. <I>Praise to Elbereth, Great Ship</I>, etc.).
			<LI>
	An Orc or Troll character may be the bearer of a hero item, but all bonuses

	- Normally, non-overt Fallen-wizard companies and Wizard companies may not attack each other. If using this optional rule, a company containing a Fallen-wizard with more than 10 stage points may initiate company vs. company combat with any of his opponent's companies. Similarly, any of his opponent's companies may initiate combat with a Fallen-wizard's own company if that Fallen-wizard has more than 10 stage points.

	- You (as a Wizard player) may include stage resource cards, minion resources, minion characters, and up to two Fallen-wizard character cards in your sideboard. If the roll for a corruption check for your Wizard is equal to his corruption point total or one less, you may choose to become a Fallen-wizard player (if not, your Wizard is eliminated and you lose). If you choose to do so and have the appropriate cards in your sideboard, you must follow this procedure:
		<UL>
