G - MARAUDING BROOD OF UGLIES 
DWAR'S CHALLENGE DECK
 
Dwar's deck sends the Lieutenant of Morgul and a detachment of Orc warriors to Dragon country and to burn a couple Border-holds down. Dwar has unwavering faith in the philosophy of might, and seeks large factions of Orcs to serve his ends. The hazards use Doors of Night to unleash packs of Wolves.

Starting Company at Dol Guldur 
• Lieutenant of Morgul, Muzgash, Lagduf, Radbug, and Tros Hesnef form the starting company. The Lieutenant controls Muzgash and Lagduf. Lagduf and Radbug each start with Foul-smelling Paste.

Resource Play 
Dwar's deck is primed for a couple delights only Ringwraith players enjoy: trophies and the Troll trio of Burat, Tuma, and Wuluag. If at all possible, place trophies with the Lieutenant of Morgul. In fact, take any opportunity to increase his direct influence. He has multiple uses for it, such as I'll Report You, controlling followers, and recruiting factions. Particularly, you want to maximize the chance of successfully recruiting the Ice-orcs. Shagrat has almost the same potential as the Lieutenant in all these respects. 
Sacrifice almost any other card to keep members of the Orc trio in hand until playable. In a company together, their benefits are remarkable for the influence they require. The trio in tandem effectively have only a -1 penalty to prowess when not tapping to face a strike. Consider this scenario. Burat and Tuma each face a strike form an attack. Burat goes first and taps --with his prowess, the strike likely fails. Tuma faces his strike next, but first taps to untap Burat. Tuma's has -1 prowess against the strike for being tapped, but Burat became untapped. 
For the 2 Border-holds there are 2 site-tapping resources: Gleaming Gold Ring and High Helm. In order to play the 2 Burning Rick, Cot and Trees, you must use these resources at their designated Border-holds and not leave the sites before burning them down. It is well worth it to discard a few hazards to keep components of the Border-hold combination in hand. 

Dwar 
Dwar does not move from Dol Guldur. During the earlier turns, he should tap to give the combat bonuses to his fledgling companies. On later turns, when the prowess of these characters increase, Dwar can freely tap to bring resources in from the sideboard. Do not forget to bring in Sudden Call during the first deck cycle. 

Hazard Play 
Nothing tricky here. Wolves and Animals do not hit as hard as other creatures, but they have a high frequency of play. 

Sideboard 
Use Dwar to bring the Minor Ring to the discard pile at his first safe opportunity. It is then available when Gleaming Gold Ring is brought to him for testing. Orders from Lugburz is good for getting the Lieutenant and Shagrat into one monster company. 
Against a Wizard consider bringing the Rebel-talks in from the sideboard and recycling Stay Her Appetite. You may remove all your opponents allies in this way and double the marshalling points from your allies.
