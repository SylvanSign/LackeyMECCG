				<B>Placement of cards "off to the side" <I>(Clarification)</I></B>
			</font>
			<BR><BR>
			Certain cards and effects require other cards to be place "off to the side"
			(e.g., <I>Sack Over the Head</I>). Cards placed off to the side are placed on 
			the playing surface off to the side of the normal area of play. Such cards 
			are kept with their host-permanent event that caused this effect. Any card 
			off to the side absolutely cannot be targeted or otherwise affected by the 
			game except by cards that specifically affect cards "off the side."
			<BR><BR>
			Cards placed off to the side are in play for the purposes of uniqueness. 
			Unless stated otherwise, when a host permanent-event is removed from the 
			playing surface, any cards off to the side under it are discarded. Usually 
			the host card will state some mechanic that affects the cards placed off to 
			the side with it. Unless stated otherwise on its host card, a card placed 
			off to the side will give its marchalling points to its owner.

				<B>HOARDS</B>
			</FONT>
			<BR><BR>                    
			Certain item are <I>hoard items</I>. Such an item may only be played at a 
			site that contains a hoard. Each site with a dragon automatic-attack (i.e., 
			each Dragon's lair) contains a hoard. A hoard minor item may not be included
			with a starting company, and may not be played at a site that does not contain 
			a hoard.
			<BR><BR>
			<B>Example:</B> You can not play a hoard minor item at Mount Gram 
			after successfully influencing the <I>Orcs of Angmar</I> like you can do 
			with a normal minor item. Mount Gram does not contain a hoard.
			<BR><BR>
			<font size="+1">
				<B>REGION MOVEMENT LIMITATION</B>
			</FONT>
			<BR><BR>
			Normally, a company moving with region movement may lay down a maximum of 
			four region cards. If a company moving with region movement is using 
			effects that allow additional region cards to be laid down, no more that 
			six regions may be used.
			<BR><BR>
			<font size="+1">
				<B>CHARACTERS FACING MULTIPLE STRIKES</B>
			</FONT>
			<BR><BR>
			Certain effect allow a character to be assigned more than one strike from 
			a given attack. Such a character must face a strike sequence for each strike 
			he is assigned to face. If a character is tapped or wounded following one 
			of these strike sequences, he must then accordingly modify his prowess for 
			any following strike sequences. If a character is eliminated or 
			otherwise removed from the game before he has faced all of his assigned 
			strikes, those strikes he has yet to face are then considered canceled 
			(i.e., they have no further effect).

				<B>CREATURES AS AUTOMATIC ATTACKS</B>
			</FONT>
			<BR><BR>
			Any hazard creature you play as an automatic-attack is discarded 
			if defeated---it is not placed in your opponent's marshalling point pile.

				<B>THE UNDER-DEEPS</B>
			</FONT>
			<BR><BR>
			<B>Note:</B> Created by streams of molten rock and expanded by 
			geothermal eruptions
			of super-hot gas, the Under-deeps are a result of a combination of natural and
			supernatural forces. The hand of Morgoth joined what was once a collection of
			countless, sundered cavern complexes. His greater servants used this maze of
			tunnels and chambers to travel surreptitiously throughout Endor. 
			<BR><BR>
			Although Endor changed during the Elder Days, the core of the Under-deeps
			survive. Though travel between the underground sites is now difficult, if not
			impossible, for all but the greatest (and luckiest) explorers. Blocked 
			or twisting
			away from their original course, the Under-deeps seem broken. Junctions and
			strongholds seem lost. Many appear as simple caves or side passages, no longer
			resembling their past grandeur. Others lie hidden behind veils of rock. 
			Nearly all
			are still there, though, awaiting discovery-as is their creator.
			<BR><BR>
			An Under-deeps site card has "Under-deeps" in the section that normally gives a
			site's region, and its name contains "\ldots-deeps" or "Under-..." 
			An Under-deeps site is
			just like any other site with the following exceptions: 
			<UL>
			<LI>     Unlike other sites, each Under-deeps site is <B>not</B> considered 
			to be in a
					 region-instead it is located below another site, called the Under-deeps
					 site's <I>surface site</I>. 
			<LI>     Instead of a nearest Haven, each Under-deeps site lists all of 
			its "Adjacent
					 Sites." Each Under-deeps site is adjacent to its one surface site and a
					 number of other Under-deeps sites. The first adjacent site listed is always
					 the Under-deeps site's surface site. 
			<LI>     <I>Eagle-mounts</I> and <I>Gwaihir</I> cannot be used to move to 
			or from an
					 Under-deeps site. 
			<LI>    A company moving to and/or from an Under-deeps site has no site path.
					 So, hazards may only be played keyed to the company's new site. 
			<LI>     An environment card that changes site type (e.g., 
			<I>Choking Shadows</I>, {\it Quiet
					 Lands}, etc.) cannot be used to change the site type of an 
					 Under-deeps site. 
			<LI>     You may not consider marshalling points associated with a company 
			at an
					 Under-deeps site for the purposes of calling the Free Council or 
					 the Audience with Sauron. 
			<LI>     Normally, when you successfully play an item, faction, ally, 
			or information
					 at a site, the site card is tapped and one additional character may tap to
					 play a minor item. At an Under-deeps site, you can play any item playable at
					 the site instead of this minor item. 
			</UL>
			<BR><BR>
			<B>Example:</B> Asternak taps and plays <I>High Helm</I> (a major item) at 
			The Under-grottos and the site taps. At this point, Dorelas could only tap 
			to play a minor item at a non-Under-deeps site. But The Under-grottos is 
			an Under-deeps site, so Dorelas can tap to play anything playable at 
			The Under-grottos: a minor item, a major item, or a gold ring. He taps and 
			plays a <I>Gold Ring That Sauron Fancies</I>.}
			<BR><BR>

				<B>Under-deep Site Movement</B>
			</FONT>
			<BR><BR>
			One of your companies that begins its turn at the surface site of an Under-deeps
			site can move normally <I>or</I> it can move to its adjacent Under-deeps site (i.e., the
			company moves to an Under-deeps site from its surface site). One of your
			companies that begins its turn at an Under-deeps site may only move to one of
			the adjacent sites listed on the Under-deeps site card.
			<BR><BR>
			Each adjacent site is followed by a number in parentheses-this number indicates
			how difficult it is to move from the Under-deeps site to the adjacent site. When an
			adjacent site is revealed by one of your companies whose site of origin is an
			Under-deeps site, you must make a roll (2D6). If the result is greater than or equal
			to the number in parentheses following the adjacent site as listed on its site of
			origin, the movement/hazard phase proceeds normally. Otherwise, the company
			returns to its site of origin (no cards are drawn)and the movement/hazard phase proceeds as if the
			company had not moved. 
			<BR><BR>
			<B>Note:</B> A company moving from a surface site to its Under-deeps site does not
			need to make a roll.
			<BR><BR>
			<B>Example:</B> A minion company that starts at Carn Dum can move normally or it can move to The
			Iron-deeps---The Iron-deeps lists Carn Dum as an adjacent site. Similarly, a
			minion company that starts at The Iron-deeps may attempt to move to any adjacent site
			listed: Carn Dum (0), The Under-leas (5), or The Under-vaults (6). However, after
			committing to movement, the moving player must roll a 5 or better to
			successfully move to The Under-leas or a 6 or better to successfully move to The
			Under-vaults.
