Resource Play 
The diplomat skill rises to the forefront in Radagast's deck. You should only begrudgingly discard New Friendships. This card helps with corruption checks, influence attempts, and Flatter a Foe, which 
can devastate a well planned turn of hazards. 
Try to play Forewarned Is Forearmed only in response to the play of a creature or automatic-attack it affects. You do not want an opponent to have an easy shot at killing your Assassin.
 
Radagast 
Radagast must play an active role for this deck to succeed. He certainly should move through Wilderness to draw extra cards, but do not feel you should maximize the Wildernesses in his site path or draw all the cards he has coming. You can always draw cards one at a time and determine the potential of each before choosing to burden your hand with more. If Radagast does not keep the card drawing in check, you will draw more marshalling point sources than you can play in one turn. This forces you to discard hazards or resource tactical options while you wait to play the marshalling points. If you discard the marshalling points instead, you may not be able to accumulate enough when later turns arrive. 
Radagast's direct influence should be used to control characters as soon as possible in order to free general influence. Until this happens, the deck is vulnerable to Muster Disperses and influence attempts by an opponent. The fact that he and a follower or two form a second strong company allows you to play more resources from your hand. His special ability then allows you to draw the next round of marshalling points-or a good complement of hazards-more regularly.
 
Hazard Play 
This deck has what is possibly the best creature in the game, Assassin. If the option is available, use Thrice Outnumbered to recycle Assassin (unless you know your opponent is not going near its keyable sites). 

Sideboard 
Against a corruption strategy, tap Radagast to bring in Clamours of Surpassing Excellence as soon as possible. This card is more affective against corruption than meets the eye. 
The Dragon Ahunt cards offer a nice opportunity against opponents who travel consistently in their affected regions, so quickly bring these in once you recognize you are playing the right opponent.
