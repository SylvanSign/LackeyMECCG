F - SPIES AND TRAITORS
ADONAPHEL'S CHALLENGE DECK 

Adunaphel sends traitorous bands bent upon thievery and espionage into the untaimed domains of the Free Peoples. Her inherent knowledge of these areas provides some cover, but her missions are extremely difficult to carry out. The hazards feature a potent offering of Drakes.

• Ciryaher controls Ostisen. Ostisen starts with Foul-smelling Paste.

Resource Play 
Adunaphel's deck has many resources that need one or more extra turns of preparation before awarding marshalling points. This makes the deck slow and requires holding cards in hand for a long time. What is more, unlucky dice rolling can devastate this deck. The only consolation is that your marshalling point sources are generous, and that successfully playing this deck can be very rewarding. Amassing marshalling points from characters is key, so consider seriously the play of sources of extra influence. 
It is not necessary to play both Dwarven Rings. In fact, they appear in duplicate to ease the plight of playing one. Make a reasonable effort to play both, but not at the expense of attack avoidance or easier marshalling point sources. Give the first Dwarven Ring to Asternak. He should try to influence the Wose faction with either the Dwarven Ring or Join With that Power. 
Note that Deeper Shadow cancels and discards the second hazard against a moving 2-character company containing Ciryaher. 

Adunaphel 
Adunaphel's role is simple. She sits in Dol Guldur and cancels one attack a turn. However, you have many attack avoidance cards. During organization phases when you have 3 or more such cards in hand (include Deeper Shadow), she should tap to bring a resource in from the sideboard. Evaluate your opponent's hazards or your own marshalling point needs to make this choice. Recognizing when you do not need her attack cancellation is critical to this deck's success. 

Hazard Play 
To complement your difficult resource strategy is a deadly mix of Drake hazards. Key to successfully using them is knowing both what and how to recycle with From the Pits of Angband. Sending a drake back to your hand with Doors of Night is not always best, especially with a resource strategy requiring a lot of cards in hand. Do not hesitate to place a drake with Summons from Long Sleep to get it out of yourhand. You do sacrifice its surprise value this way, but you also may cause an opponent to overestimate the threat against him and adjust his movement accordingly. 

Sideboard 
During your opponent's first untap phase when you have few hazards in hand, half his hazard limit. Then bring Itangast Ahunt, Sand-drake, and True Cold-drake to your discard pile. These cards will be available options when From the Pits of Angband hits the table.
