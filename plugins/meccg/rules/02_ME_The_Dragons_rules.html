		<p>The following rules were distributed in all Middle-earth: the Dragons
		boosters, but in case you don't have one...

		<p>This insert provides expansion rules, clarifications, and a scenario for use
		with both Middle-earth: The Wizards (METW) and Middle-earth: The Dragons (METD).
		These rules are recommended for all METW games even if METD is not used.
		<h2><a name="keys"></a>Key Words and Terms (Clarification)</h2>
		<p>A "key word" is an identifier for a card which makes it affectable by or
		usable with other cards as the cards' text dictate.  For example, in METW, key
		words include: Orc, spell, environment, Dragon, Undead, Wolves, etc.
		Middle-earth: The Dragons introduces several "key words" to the Middle-earth
		collectible card game: Drake, light enchantment, dark enchantment, ritual,
		riddling attempt, riddling roll, offering attempt, flatter attempt, capture, and
		helmet.  There are no special rules for these key words; except that a character
		may only use the effects of one helmet at a time.  Note that the key words,
		Dragon and Drake, are mechanically independent.  Some of the key words are not
		affected by any currently existing cards (e.g. offering attempt and capture),
		but they will be with the release of future expansions.
		A "bearer" of a specific card refers to the character that bears or controls
		that card.
		<h2><a name="lairs"></a>Dragon Lairs</h2>
		<p>Any one site with a Dragon automatic-attack is a Dragon's lair.  There are
		nine unique Dragons associated with the following lairs:

		<h2><a name="hoards"></a>Hoards</h2>
		Certain items are hoard items.  Such an item may only be played at a site that
		contains a hoard.  Each site with a Dragon automatic-attack (i.e. each Dragon's
		lair) contains a hoard.  A hoard minor item may not be included with a starting
		company, and may not be played at a site that does not contain a hoard.
		<p>Example: you can not play a hoard minor item at Wellinghall after
		successfully influencing the Ents of Fangorn like you can with a normal minor
		item.  Wellinghall does not contain a hoard.
		<h2><a name="manifest"></a>Manifestations of Dragons</h2>
		Each of the nine unique Dragons (see above) has three different manifestations:
		<p><strong>Basic</strong> -- In this manifestation a Dragon is in his standard
		active mode.  Each of these manifestations is represented by a standard creature
		card (e.g. the cards for Smaug, Agburanar, Daelomin, and Leucaruth from METW).
		<p><strong>Ahunt</strong> -- In this manifestation a Dragon is considered to be
		hunting in a wide range of regions.  Each of these manifestations is represented
		by a hazard long-event that will attack any company moving in a given set of
		regions (e.g. Smaug Ahunt normally causes an attack against any company moving
		in Withered Heath, Northern Rhovanion, Iron Hills, and/or Grey Mountain
		Narrows).
		<p><strong>At Home</strong> -- In this manifestation a Dragon is considered to
		be resident in his lair.  Each of these manifestations is represented by a
		hazard permanent-event that gives its lair an additional automatic-attack and
		causes certain other global-effects (e.g. Scorba At Home gives Zarak Dum an
		additional automatic-attack and each major item gives an additional corruption
		point).
		<p>Different manifestations of the same Dragon may be in play at the same time.
		The fact that each manifestation is unique unto itself does not preclude the
		other manifestations.
		<p>Only your opponent can receive marshaling points from defeating a
		manifestation of a Dragon that you played.  If you defeat a Dragon manifestation
		that you played, it is removed from the game and no one receives its marshaling
		points.
		<p>If at any time an attack from a manifestation of a unique Dragon is defeated
		or if the manifestation is otherwise removed from the game:
		<ul><li>All existing manifestations in play of the same Dragon are removed from
		the game
		<li>No further manifestations of the same Dragon may be played.
		<li>The Dragon's lair no longer has an automatic-attack.
		</ul>
		<p>Example: You have played Smaug at Home and Smaug Ahunt (both are still in
		play).  Then you play Dragon's Desolation and Smaug on one of your opponent's
		companies at Weathertop.  Your opponent plays Old Thrush, rolls lucky, and
		defeats Smaug.  He gets 5 MPs from defeating Smaug and Smaug, Smaug at Home, and
		Smaug Ahunt are all removed from play and The Lonely Mountain (Smaug's lair) no
		longer has an automatic-attack.
		<br>If, instead, one of your own companies had gone to The Lonely Mountain and
		defeated Smaug at Home, you would not receive the 5 MPs.
		<h2><a name="limit"></a>Hazard Limit (Clarification)</h2>
		<p>The base hazard limit is determined (i.e. set) simultaneously at the moment
		a company reveals its new site or otherwise announces it is beginning its
		movement/hazard phase.  Any cards which modify a company's hazard limit played
		prior to this point are then immediately applied to the company's base hazard
		limit in the order chose by the player controlling the company.  With such
		modifications established, any cards played after this point are interpreted in
		the order they are resolved.  Any effects which modify the hazard limit against
		a company during its site phase are ignored.  Any reduction in the hazard limit
		during a movement/hazard phase does not affect cards already announced and
		played.
		<h2><a name="multiple"></a>Characters Facing Multiple Strikes</h2>
		<p>When certain Middle-earth: The Dragons cards are played, a character may be
		assigned to receive more than one strike from a given attack.  Such a character
		must face a strike sequence for each strike he is assigned to face.  If a
		character is tapped or wounded following one of these strike sequences, he must
		then accordingly modify his prowess for any following strike sequences.  If a
		character is eliminated or otherwise removed from play before he has faced all
		of his assigned strikes, those strikes he has yet to face are then considered
		to be canceled (i.e. they have no further effect.
		<h2><a name="corruption"></a>Removing Corruption Cards</h2>
		<p>A character may chose to ignore the restriction that he tap to remove a
		corruption card (as printed on a corruption card), and suffer a -3 penalty to
		the dice roll to remove it.  This means a character can remain untapped and
		still attempt to remove a corruption card (the roll is modified by -3), or
		that he can attempt to remove a corruption card even if he is already tapped or
		wounded (the roll is modified by -3).
		<p>A character may only attempt to remove each corruption card once per turn if
		he ignores the tapping restriction to do so.
		<p>Example: During his organization phase, Beorn has 3 corruption cards: Lure
		of Nature, Lure of Expedience, and Lure of the Senses.  He taps and rolls to
		attempt to remove the lure of the Senses; his roll was an 8, so the card is
		removed (greater than 6 was required).  If, instead, Beorn had not tapped for
		this attempt, he would have failed (he would have needed to roll a 10 or
		better).  He then rolls to attempt to remove Lure of Nature; his roll is a 6
		modified by -3 for a net result of 3, so the card is not removed (greater than
		4 was required).  Finally, he rolls to attempt to remove Lure of Expedience; his
		roll is a 9 modified by -3 for a net result of 6, so the card is removed
		(greater than 5 was required).
		<h2><a name="sideboard"></a>The Sideboard</h2>
		<p>With the publication of Middle-earth: The Dragons, the number of different
		resource and hazard strategies increases dramatically.  To enable players to
		react to more specific strategies during play, the sideboard size is increased
		by five (e.g., from 15 to 20 for the 1-deck and 2-deck games, from 20 to 25 for
		the 3-deck game, etc.).
		<p>At the end of your opponent's untap phase, if your opponent's Wizard is in
		play, you may at this point bring up to five hazard cards from your sideboard
		to your discard pile; or if your play deck has at least 5 cards, you may bring
		one hazard card directly from your sideboard into your play deck (reshuffle).
		If you move cards from your sideboard in this fashion, the hazard limit for each
		of your opponent's companies is reduced to half of normal (round up, e.g., a
		hazard limit of 2 becomes 1, a hazard limit of 3 becomes 2, etc.).
		<h2><a name="regions"></a>Region Movement Limitation</h2>
		<p>Normally, a company moving with region movement may lay down a maximum of
		four region cards.  If a company moving with region movement is using effects
		that allows additional region cards to be laid down, no more than six regions
		may be used.
