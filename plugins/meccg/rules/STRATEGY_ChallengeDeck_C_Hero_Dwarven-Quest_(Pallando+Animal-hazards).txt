Resource Play 
This deck is loaded with items giving strong tactical advantages in play. Corruption is a natural danger when playing a large number of items, so take the time to play both Fellowships. 
In a deck using one large company, resources that allow multiple marshalling point sources to be played in one turn are needed for speed. This deck has three: Bouncy of the Hoard, Lucky Search, and Thror's Map. Take special care to use these to their full advantage. Thror's Map is the most powerful of the bunch, so never discard it. Note that Lucky Search can only be played at Dead Marshes, Goblin­gate, Moria, or Sam Goriwing --not at a Dragon's Lair. 
This deck can fight creatures for marshalling points or cancel the overwhelming threats. After the first few risky turns, the Dwarven company should be in a comfortable position when attacked.
 
Pallando 
Pallando should move to Lorien and form a company there from the play deck. This company is responsible for playing the two allies and the Book of Mazarbul --if not played with the Dwarves on an early turn. Otherwise, Pallando should not move unless you can properly protect him with tactical options from your hand. After playing Quickbeam, relocate Pallando's company to Rivendell. Tap Pallando to bring the Blue Mountain Dwarves into the play deck. His company should be in a convenient position to move to the Blue Mountain Dwarf-hold to store the Book of Mazarbul and play this faction.
 
Hazard Play 
The hazards attempt to swarm an opponent with high frequency of play creatures. Do not underestimate the role of Neeker-breekers. The greatest threats are the spiders and Watchers in the Water enhanced with Full of Froth and Rage and Wake of War. The hazards also have a roadblock sub theme that fills out its blind spots in the dark areas against Ringwraith opponents. 

Sideboard 
The sideboarding for this deck is not as important as with other Challenge Decks. The most important play is bringing in the Blue Mountain Dwarves after playing the Book of Mazarbul. If you believe your opponent has any sort of Dragon or Drake creatures, bring in The Old Thrush.
