I - MORGUL RALLYING CRY
THE WITCH-KING'S CHALLENGE DECK 

The Witch-king's mission is to solidify Sauron's forces in Mordor. His minions do best when not moving from the safety of this evil domain. They have very little to help them tactically, but in Mordor they should not need much. The hazards can create a devastating environment of roadblock.
 
Starting Companies (3) at Minas Morgul 
• One Orc Captain controls Ill-favoured Fellow. This company travels to Mount Doom to sit for most of the game. 
• Horseman in the Night controls Orc Veteran. Horseman in the Night starts with Blazon ofthe Eye. This company travels to Nurniag Camp to sit for most of the game.
• The other Orc Captain and Orc Brawler form the third company. This Orc Captain starts with Blazon of the Eye, and the company travels to Cirith Gorgor to sit for most of the game.

Resource Play 
Play the Awaiting the Calls on the 2 Orc Captains to free enough general influence to bring in more characters. This means you should play That Ain't No Secret on the Ill-favoured Fellow since the 
Orc Captain at Moun Doom ideally should not move to store this event. The lesser mind haracters will "shuttle" between sites, storing resources, delivering Records Unread to Nurniag Camp, etc. Note that the lower mind characters from the deck can come into play under direct influence at the Dark-holds. 

The Witch-king 
The Witch-king moves with Fell Rider to Minas Tirith to play the Palantir, and to Barad-dur to play Helm of Fear. Playing these items requires him to tap twice. Otherwise, the Witch-king, as the deck's only sage, should be untapped to play Voices of Malice to discard Foolish Words or other debilitating hazard permanent-events. Foofish Words can be revealed as an on-guard card in response to an attempt to play a faction. During the site phase, with Voices of Malice in hand, the Witch-king should wait for all faction attempts before himself playing an item. He can always wait another turn to play his item.
 
Hazard Play 
This deck has an unusual hazard strategy that often causes great frustration for an opponent --the "Roadblock Strategy." Its goal is to prevent an opponent from reaching his new site or to tap his new site prematurely to prevent the play of resources. An opponent who recognizes this strategy should forget all other sideboarding needs and bring in his anti-roadblock resources. These include Gates of Morning, Skies of Fire, Promptings of Wisdom, and Piercing All Shadows. As for your play, the key is your An Unexpected Outposts. You must choose your cards to recycle from Long Winters, Snowstorm, Doors of Night, another An Unexpected Outpost, and Twilight.
 
Sideboard 
If Voices of Malice is not in hand, or if you will not try to influence a faction, tap the Witch-king to bring in a resource from the sideboard. Above the Abyss against a Wizard opponent is invaluable. When a company of 3 or more Orcs forms at Minas Morgul, bring in Last Child of Ungoliant. You should play her near the end of the first deck cycle. Of course, you will need Sudden Call towards the end ofthe first cycle. Hazard-wise, bringing in Foul Fumes against certain Wizard opponents can be important.
